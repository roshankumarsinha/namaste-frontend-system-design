    PWA is like a native app, but it is built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  </li>
  <li>
    PWA can be installed on the user's device, which means that it can be accessed from the home screen, just like a native app.
  </li>
  <li>
    PWA can work offline, which means that it can be used even when the user is offline.
  </li>
  <li>
    Two things are required to make a PWA:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A service worker, which is a script that runs in the background and can intercept network requests
        and cache them.
      </li>
      <li>
        A manifest file, which is a JSON file that contains metadata about the PWA, such as the name, icons, and start URL.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    PWA can be added to the home screen, which means that it can be accessed from the home screen, just like a native app.
  </li>
  <li>
    PWA can be used to implement push notifications, which means that the user can receive notifications
    even when the PWA is not open.
  </li>
</ul>
