    <h1>Rendering Pattern</h1>

            <h3>Client-Side Rendering (CSR)</h3>
            <p><b>What is Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?</b></p>
            <p>Client-Side Rendering is a method where the browser (the client) is responsible for rendering the content of the web page after downloading it. This means the server initially sends an almost empty HTML file with a reference to the JavaScript code (bundled in a file). Once the browser downloads and executes the JavaScript, it fetches the necessary data (typically through APIs) and dynamically builds and updates the content on the page.</p>
            <p><b>How CSR Works (Step-by-Step)</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Initial Request:</b>The client (browser) sends a request to the server for a webpage (e.g., example.com/home).</li>
                <li><b>Empty HTML Response:</b>The server responds with an almost empty HTML file, which usually contains a minimal structure (such as <div id="root"></div>) and links to the JavaScript files needed for rendering the page.</li>
                <li><b>JavaScript Execution:</b>The browser downloads the JavaScript bundles and executes them. <br />
                    The JavaScript (typically from a framework/library like React, Vue, or Angular) takes control, fetches the necessary data from APIs or other services, and dynamically generates the HTML elements on the page.</li>
                <li><b>Hydration:</b>Then hydration(attaching event listeners) happens. Since it is a CSR hydration is easy and fast.</li>
                <li><b>Content Rendering:</b>Once the data is received and the DOM (Document Object Model) is updated, the page becomes interactive, and users can interact with the dynamic content (such as forms, buttons, and other interactive elements).</li>
                <li><b>Subsequent Navigation:</b>Unlike traditional multi-page websites where navigating to a new page would require a full page reload, CSR typically updates only parts of the page, ensuring smoother transitions between different sections (using routing techniques like React Router).</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Disadvantages of CSR:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>SEO Challenges:</b>One of the major drawbacks of CSR is SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Since the content is rendered in the browser and search engines often rely on static HTML for crawling and indexing, websites using CSR can be harder to optimize for search engines.</li>
                <li><b>Slow Initial Load (Time-to-First-Byte):</b>In CSR, the user initially receives a very basic HTML file, which doesn't contain much useful content. The browser then has to download and execute the JavaScript files, fetch data from APIs, and finally render the content.
                   <br /> This process can make the initial load slower, especially on slower connections or lower-end devices. This is often called "blank screen" syndrome as users might see a blank page until the JavaScript finishes loading.</li>
                <li><b>JavaScript Dependency:</b>Since CSR relies heavily on JavaScript, users with JavaScript disabled or unsupported in their browsers will not be able to access the site properly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
