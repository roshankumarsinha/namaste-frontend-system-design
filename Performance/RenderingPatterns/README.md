            <p><b>What is Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?</b></p>
            <p>Client-Side Rendering is a method where the browser (the client) is responsible for rendering the content of the web page after downloading it. This means the server initially sends an almost empty HTML file with a reference to the JavaScript code (bundled in a file). Once the browser downloads and executes the JavaScript, it fetches the necessary data (typically through APIs) and dynamically builds and updates the content on the page.</p>
