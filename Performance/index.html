    <h1>General HTML performance considerations</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cache HTML responses : </b>Caching HTML responses is difficult, since the response may include links to other critical resources such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resource types.
            Nonetheless, a short cache lifetime—rather than no caching—can have benefits such as allowing a resource to be cached at a CDN—reducing the number of requests that are served from the origin server—and in the browser, allowing resources to be revalidated rather than downloaded again.
            Five minutes for static HTML resources is a safe bet, and ensures that periodic updates don't go unnoticed.
            A cautious approach to caching HTML could be to use the ETag. Whenever the resource changes, a new ETag value must be generated. On subsequent requests, the browser sends the ETag value.If the ETag on the server matches the one sent by the browser, the server responds with a 304 Not Modified response, and the browser uses the resource from the cache.
        </li>
        <li><b>Compression Technique : </b>Text-based responses such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SVG images should be compressed to reduce their transfer size over the network in order for them to download more quickly. The most widely used compression algorithms are gzip and Brotli. Brotli results in about a 15% to 20% improvement over gzip.
            Brotli provides a fairly noticeable improvement over gzip. Use Brotli when possible, but if your website is used by a high number of users on legacy browsers, be sure that gzip is used as a fallback, as any compression is better than no compression at all.
        </li>
        <li><b>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) : </b>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that cache resources from your origin server, and in turn, serves them from edge servers that are physically closer to your users.</li>
    </ul>
